# Welcome to the `plonky2-gpu` Repository!

In the pursuit of cryptographic efficiency, we introduce `plonky2-gpu` â€” a GPU-accelerated version of the [Plonky2](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2) project. This iteration leverages the CUDA framework and represents a comprehensive reengineering of the original Plonky2 codebase. It specifically focuses on optimizing three key computations: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Merkle tree construction, and polynomial manipulation. 

**Hardware Requirements:**
- **CPU:** 8 cores
- **RAM:** 16GB
- **GPU:** NVIDIA 2080 Ti
- **GPU RAM:** 12GB

**Examples:**
- [`Plonky2-25519`](https://github.com/sideprotocol/plonky2-ed25519): Discover the enhanced performance, specially optimized for ed25519 signatures. This accelerated implementation has notably reduced the proving time for ed25519 signatures from 45 seconds to just 5 seconds. Experience the optimized performance specifically tailored for ed25519 signatures.
