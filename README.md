# Welcome to the plonky2-gpu Repository!

In the pursuit of cryptographic efficiency, we present `plonky2-gpu` â€” a GPU-accelerated iteration of the Plonky2 project. Leveraging the CUDA framework, this repository embodies a meticulous reengineering of the original Plonky2 codebase, with a specific focus on optimizing three pivotal calculations: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Merkle tree construction, and polynomial manipulation.

The accelerated performance is strikingly evident in real-world scenarios, as exemplified by the reduction of proving time for ed25519 signatures from 45 seconds to an astounding 5 seconds. We invite developers, cryptographers, and enthusiasts to explore the power of GPU parallelization in cryptographic operations and witness the tangible advancements achieved by `plonky2-gpu`. Join us in the evolution of Zero Knowledge Prove!
